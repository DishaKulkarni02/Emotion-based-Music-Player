# Emotion-based-Music-Player
In this Deep Learning-based project, the user gets music recommendations based on his mood and if he is drowsy he gets a wake-up call. The Programming language used here is Python. 
For Face Detection, OpenCV library is used and for Mood Detection, Keras is used here

Steps to run this project :

1.Run the code and wait for a second or two.
2.Camera window will open.
3.Ensure that your full face is visible in the camera.
4.Press Q button of keyboard to capture image and it will automatically send it to the system.
5.As soon as emotion is recognized, the user is redirected to web browser and web browser will open Spotifyâ€™s window.
6. Spotify will open with playlists suggestions with one song played automatically.
7. You can select song manually if you want to change song.

If emotion is **sleepy** and **user is** **driving a car** then,
1. Song will not get played instead alert will be generated sounding wakeup up.
2. It will stop as soon as you press Q button manually.
